Dear ${firstName},

Thank you for your interest in joining ANZIR as an AnzirAct author and for the enthusiasm you have shown towards revolutionizing the LARP industry with us.

Information required:
 	-Please upload a clear, high-resolution picture of your identity document
-Ensure that the name on the contract and authorâ€™s information match the information on your identity document
-Your identity document does not have the required information to verify your identity

At ANZIR, we strive to maintain a high standard of quality and authenticity in our author community. This process includes a thorough review of the information provided by our applicants and ensuring that their identity is verified to be authentic. Unfortunately, in your case, we found that the details provided were not sufficient for us to approve your application.

We believe in providing our authors with the freedom to express their unique styles and creativity. However, this must be balanced with ensuring that our platform maintains its integrity and trustworthiness. Therefore, we encourage you to reapply with a more detailed submission and clearer identity verification documentation.
